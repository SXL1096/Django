I'm looking forward to learning developping App in the upcoming academic year.

App is now widely used, which brings great convenience to our lives. I hope to be able to make valuable apps in the future to make people's lives better.

I learned the Java language this semester, and it just so happens that I can continue to study the App. I believe this will also bring me new challenges and happiness.

I look forward to studying in the new semester.
