I had a very fulfilling semester. I learned a lot of courses and got exposed to all kinds of new knowledge. Although the Java language is not the most difficult, it is the most interesting.

Java is a very practical language, and it has a lot of basic grammars to master. After learning a knowledge point, I need to complete the program design on the computer. During this period, I will often check my basic ability, carefulness and logic ability.

Whenever I encounter a difficulty, I need to find out the reason step by step and ask for help online. The process makes me a little anxious. But after solving the difficulties, I am very happy, and I can learn and master new things.

I know that Java is a great programming language that is used in many fields. I will also work hard to learn Java and master this powerful and useful technology.
